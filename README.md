- `main.py`: to run the script. Contains the definition of the dataset, as well as hyperparameters for training.
- `utils.py`: utility functions (plots, etc.).
- `utils_polynomial.py`: utility functions for polynomials (SOS polynomials, etc.).
- `datasets.py`: functions to generate datasets (gaussian, Voronoi, etc.).
- `models.py`: class for ICNN models.
